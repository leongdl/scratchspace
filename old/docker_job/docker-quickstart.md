I'll guide you through the process of pulling a base image, installing Python 3.11 using yum, and saving it as a new image. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, pull a base image that uses yum (like CentOS or Rocky Linux):
```bash
docker pull rockylinux:9
```

2. Run the container interactively:
```bash
docker run -it rockylinux:9 bash
```

3. Inside the container, update yum and install Python 3.11:
```bash
dnf update -y
dnf install -y python3.11
```

4. Exit the container:
```bash
exit
```

5. Find the container ID:
```bash
docker ps -a
```

6. Commit the container as a new image:
```bash
docker commit <container-id> my-python3.11-image
```

Alternatively, you can do this all in one go using a Dockerfile:

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM rockylinux:9

RUN dnf update -y && \
    dnf install -y python3.11 && \
    dnf clean all

# Optional: Set Python 3.11 as default python
RUN alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3.11
```

2. Build the image:
```bash
docker build -t my-python3.11-image .
```

The Dockerfile method is the recommended approach because:
- It's reproducible
- It's documented
- It creates smaller images (due to layer optimization)
- It's easier to share and version control

To verify your new image:
```bash
# List images
docker images

# Test the new image
docker run -it my-python3.11-image python3.11 --version
```

Note: The exact commands might vary depending on the base image you use and the package repository configuration. Some distributions might require additional repositories to be enabled for Python 3.11.
