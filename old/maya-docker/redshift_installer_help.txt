===============================================================================

Please follow these steps to complete you installation of Redshift.

1) Install redshift4maya.mod module file

Before using Redshift, Maya must be configured to know where to find the redshift4maya plugin by creating a redshift4maya.mod file in the module search path of the version(s) of Maya you are running.  By default, all versions of Maya will include ~/maya/modules in the module search path.

We have provided a template redshift4maya.mod file for reference.  Simply copy redshift4maya.mod.template to ~/maya/modules/redshift4maya.mod (create the 'modules' directory if it doesn't exist).  If you have installed Redshift to an alternate location, the template will have already been customized with your alternate install location.


[Optional] By default, Redshift "local data" path is set to ~/redshift.  Unless further customized, this path will be used to store Redshift's logs, license file and local cache.
You can change the location of the Redshift local data path by setting the environment variable "REDSHIFT_LOCALDATAPATH", either in your user profile or in your redshift4maya.mod file (or the Maya.env corresponding with your version of Maya if you opted to not use the module system)




2) Copy redshiftRenderer.xml to Maya's rendererDesc directory (required for Maya command-line rendering)

Copy the file "/usr/redshift/redshift4maya/common/rendererDesc/redshiftRenderer.xml" to /usr/autodesk/<MAYAVERSION>/bin/rendererDesc/






[Note] An alternative to using the module system is to modify the Maya.env file(s) for the particular version(s) of Maya you are running.  

By default this file is located in ~/maya/<MAYAVERSION>/Maya.env, where <MAYAVERSION> is 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024 or 2025 depending on your version of Maya.

We have provided a template Maya.env file for reference.  Note that "<MAYAVERSION>" on the second line should be replaced with the version of Maya you are installing for (e.g. "2018", "2019", "2020", "2022", "2023", "2024" or "2025").  If you have installed Redshift to a location other than /usr/redshift (the default), the template file will already contain this alternate install location, so no further customization is necessary (other than replacing "<MAYAVERSION>").

If your existing Maya.env already contains lines that conflict with those in the template, you will need to "merge" them.
For example, if your Maya.env already has a line:

MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH = /path/to/my/plugins

this would be merged with the value of MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH in the Redshift Maya.env.template as follows:

MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH = %REDSHIFT_PLUG_IN_PATH%:/path/to/my/plugins

Note that the paths are separated by a colon ":".
